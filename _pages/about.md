Hi! I'm Andrew, a junior studying computer science and biology at Stanford University. My academic/research interests include machine learning, synthetic biology, and healthcare. Over the past year, I've worked in the [Ng Lab](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/) on various projects developing and deploying machine learning models. 

Like most things going on in my life, this site is a work in progress. I don't currently have any publications, talks, or any of the usual things you'd see in a personal academic website like this (although, hopefully that will change soon!). I mainly just wanted to start writing again, and chances are I would end up making one of these anyways, so why not kill two birds with one stone?
