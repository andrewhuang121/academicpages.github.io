Hi! I'm Andrew, a senior studying computer science at Stanford University. My academic/research interests include machine learning, natural language processing, synthetic biology, and healthcare. Over the past year, I've worked in the [Ng Lab](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/) on various projects relating to improving healthcare through machine learning, and also interpretable machine learning. I'm currently interning at Facebook, where I'm working on revamping the language models for search. 

Apart from academics, I'm a crossword fiend and I make incredible scrambled eggs. I consume a lot of things: food, movies, books, sports; I try to keep a list of things I've liked in my posts. I've always loved writing, and I don't take enough pictures, so I thought this was a good way to preserve my thoughts, personality, and headspace. 

On the blog posts: I generally don't really edit my posts and I'll slap the submit button and not look at what I've written for a few months, so don't expect some tightly edited masterpiece; I try to write fairly casually (I LOVE contractions) cause that's the kind of thing I like to read! I'm trying to write more this summer but there's no guarantees lol
