# A quick update

Back at school! I love fall in California; every day is shorts weather but you can wear pants and not burn up. I'm taking mostly project-based classes now, and I'm excited to see how they turn out! 

I was gonna take this like statistical learning theory class but it turns out the professor changed and on the first day I realized I went from having all the prereqs to half of them!!! All the dick-swinging and self-validation in the WORLD is not worth the time I would've had to spend bootstrapping and self-teaching. It was also being taught by a new professor who's like clearly a genius but got caught up in a lot of algebra and then would have to rush and like skip over something important; basically I could understand proofs for the most part form step-to-step but then he would make some kind of tautological argument in order to wrap things up and I'd be fuckin LOST. The content of the class was super interesting but you can't chase statistical bounds with short legs!!! 

I'm living in Crothers, which has a reputation of being kind of a shithole, but I really like it! The location is arugably the best on campus, and I've never lived on East Campus before and I love it. Also, it's right next to a bunch of dining halls, and the rooms are like spacious enough. I've been thinking about it and I'm pretty sure the main reason people don't like Crothers is because the word *Crothers* is nasty. It's up there with like *moist* and *pulp*. It literally sounds like crud. But like, if it was called Hennessey (which comes with two added benefits of being named after a former university President AND having a cool nickname Henny), it would definitely be way higher in the housing hierarchy. This kind of taps into the kind of wild idea of nominal determinism. I realized last year that since my middle name starts with J, I could have gone by AJ my entire life. Imagine that!!! I'd be a completely different person. How many AJ's do you know that are, like, alright people (I know one). If I had grown up AJ instead of Andrew, I'd probably be a brother in Theta Apple Pie slapping a wine bag now.
