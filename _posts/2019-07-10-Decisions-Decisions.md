Hi!! 

It's been a little while since I've written one of these; something I'm trying to do this sumemr is get back into writing more. In Florence, as I was writing my art history papers I knew what I was writing was straight garbage; all writing has a shelf life, a period of time it takes before you read it again and want to Thanos-snap it away. While I was going on and on about **cOnvEXitY** in Michelangelo's work, I realized it had been years since I'd written anything with a decent shelf life that was longer than a tweet. It's something I used to do a lot more, and the process was always challenging and exciting even if the end result wasn't quite what I wanted it to be. Most of what I usually write is in response to some new change in my life: a new job, a new quarter, or a new perspective, but I wanted to mix it up this time around!

I'm going to be talking about *machine learning* today :(

This is a project I worked on in the fall, that seems like a cool idea in principle and actually worked quite well! I don't think I'm gunning for a PhD so publication in a conference isn't really that high of a priority; I think it's a simple idea that can work well in practice, provide one uses it thoughtfully. More crucially, I think it's a way to practice technical writing and explaining ideas that people kind of instantly recoil at in layman's terms, and to even try and make it fun. These are important ideas that are already shaping decisions in governments and corporations.

In particular, this project (which we called Deep-LASSO), deals with the issue of interpretability, which sounds simple but is actually a difficult concept to pin down. In this, I'll try to keep a lot of the mathy details to a minimum, but also go into asides about important related topics in the field and what I think their implications in the larger world are.
