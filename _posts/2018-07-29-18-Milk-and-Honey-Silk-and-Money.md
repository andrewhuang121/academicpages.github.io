For past month and a half, I've been working at an asset management fund (my finance friends tell me to call it a hedge fund for the CLOUT but I couldn't tell you the difference). It's been a lot of fun! I like my coworkers, there's snacks, we get lunch ordered in, the offices all have a great view of the city, and they're giving me projects where I get to learn a little bit about infance, but the problems I'm solving are almost entirely based on things that I know/things that are pretty likely to be useful for what I might want to do in the future.

I'll be honest, coming into the summer, I abhorred the financial industry. I think it's incredibly necessary; companies need to get funded, people need to be able to take out loans. My major qualms about it were drawn mostly from *The Big Short* (a fantastic movie that made me want to throw things and kill the first banking boi I saw) and my ANGEL of a roommate Nicholas "Nickypoo" Branigan, who is the rarest of all animals: a non-finance Econ major. The problems are interesting, but as Nickypoo put it: "Yeah, but should the smartest fucking people we know be making powerpoint slides day?" To top it off, I can be the first person to tell you that the math that they use is from the 1800's and mfing ridge regression/L2-regularization/"let's make the numbers in our model small so they can't get TOO wild" is groundbreaking shit. 

However, the money is ridiculous. And I like to eat well.
