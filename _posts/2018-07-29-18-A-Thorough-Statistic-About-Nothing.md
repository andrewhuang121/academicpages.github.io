It begins at a Lululemon. I'm walking in New York with two of my favorite people on earth, DJ Jayachandran and Han Gu. We've just entered a queue for a table at a restaurant that we will spend the next two hours waiting for. For context: I am dressed in a tech t-shirt, the same shorts that I wore the day before (and the day before that, and maybe the day before that), since the next day is laundry day and I'm down to that part of your closet where you sigh and think about if there's anything in the laundry basket that won't smell before you put it on. 

DJ is raving about their shorts, which sport revolutionary ABC (anti-ball crushing) technology. "It's a fucking game changer. I can't go back." (Disclaimer: crushed balls have never really been a problem for me, so I can't *really* speak to whether or not it is a game changer.) We get to the store (after first wandering into the women's store across the street. Good on the employees for not pointing out the mistake away! New York is #woke) Turns out these fuckers are like basically the same as the Nike running shorts you go commando in that I love so dearly... but at a price point of $70. 

Naturally, Han and I roasted him, but then, as DJ is want to due, said something deeply profound and unforgettable.

> Yo, at some point you gotta stop going for bang per buck, and just go for bang.
